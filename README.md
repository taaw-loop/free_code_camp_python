# free_code_camp_python
Tutorials I've completed from freecodecamp.org's Scientific Computing with Python (Beta) Course 

I've created this repository to reference my completed work in the course. I also hope my progress can encourage others in their own Python journey.
If you're working through the courses, please only use this repository as a reference. Do not copy and paste answers to questions.
For assistance with any issues or questions, please visit the forum.freecodecamp.org
